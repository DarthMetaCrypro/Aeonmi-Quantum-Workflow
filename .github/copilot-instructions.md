## Project Status
- **Frontend**: Complete React/TypeScript application with 5 main components
- **Security**: BB84 quantum key distribution implemented in Rust
- **Backend**: Flask API with quantum ML and AI optimization
- **Build System**: Ready for Tauri desktop app packaging
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and setup instructions

## Next Steps
- Integrate Tauri for standalone .exe packaging
- Connect frontend with backend APIs
- Add quantum algorithm visualizations
- Implement advanced AI workflow optimization

## Development Guidelines
- Use quantum-themed UI with blue/cyan gradients (#00d4ff, #0099cc)
- Maintain security-first architecture with BB84 integration
- Follow React/TypeScript best practices
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Document all quantum security features

## Communication Rules
- Avoid verbose explanations
- Keep responses concise and focused
- Do not explain project structure unless asked
- Use technical accuracy for quantum computing concepts

## Development Rules
- Use current directory as project root
- No external links or media unless requested
- Use VS Code API only for extension projects
- Follow project setup information strictly
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
