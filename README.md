## Project prompts and guidelines

A repository-level assistant prompt and contributor guidance has been added:

- **QUANTUMFORGE SUPER PROMPT** — [docs/QUANTUMFORGE_SUPER_PROMPT.md](docs/QUANTUMFORGE_SUPER_PROMPT.md)

This file contains the recommended instruction set for AI assistants and contributor tooling interacting with this repository (Micro AI guidance, UX rules, implementation practices). Contributors and automation should reference it when generating or reviewing changes that influence UX, AI behavior, security, or backend contracts.
